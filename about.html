<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I’m Joshua L Homo, a web developer and programmer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. <br>
I have a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering and three years of experience in the manufacturing industry, <br>
where I learned how to optimize processes, solve problems, and work in a team.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, I realized that my true calling was in web development, so I decided to enroll in a web developer course and<br>
learn the latest technologies and best practices in the field. I have completed several projects using HTML, CSS,<br>
JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress, which you can see in my portfolio below. Some of the features I have implemented <br>
include responsive design, user authentication, database integration, and e-commerce functionality.<br>
</p>
<p>
I have also received positive feedback from my instructors and peers, who praised my creativity, attention to detail,<br> 
and coding skills. I am always eager to learn new things and improve my craft, so I regularly take online courses, read<br>
blogs, and participate in forums related to web development.<br>
</p>
<p>
I am looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in web development and programming, and to help<br>
clients create stunning and user-friendly websites that meet their goals and expectations. Whether you need a simple <br>
landing page, a complex web application, or anything in between, I can deliver high-quality results that will exceed<br>
your standards.<br>
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me anytime. I would love to hear from you and <br>
discuss how we can collaborate on your next project. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and have a great day!<br>
